# HaskellSnake

A simple snake game made for fun to learn functional progrmain and the Gloss Library for Haskell.

To set up this project simply run `cabal install` then `cabal build` and `cabal run HaskellSnake`.

Runing `cabal install gloss` might also be necessary, but i'm really not sure, i barely even undestran the haskell build systems and package managers's enviroment. lol

Quit with `ctrl + q`

It's also kinda wonky, i plan to revisit this soon and make some much needed improvements
